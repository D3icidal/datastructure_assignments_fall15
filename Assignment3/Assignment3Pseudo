//Read data into 1D array of strings

//Loop begin reading 1D into List  
    //If "R"    Add to end of list as int for qty, and a float for price
    
    //If "P"    Set a int promoCount varable to 2 to indicate promotion start
                set PromoDiscount variable to %
    
    
    //if "S"    salePrice = 0
                Set qtySold and qtyNeeded. Cout
                If qtyNeeded>0
                ***Need to find someway of checking if this is end of list and still do command.

                        totaleSale++salePrice
                        qtyNode --qtyNeeded //subtract qtyNeeded from current node

                    salePrice = ((Node Price * MU)*Promo) 
                    cout "Promo Applied: Promo"
                else
                    salePrice = ((Node Price * MU)) 
                
                
                
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Promo calculation (100-promo)*0.01 
    so 25% = 0.75, then just multiply result by 0.75
    
Alt Promo calculation:    discount = (salePrice * (promo / 100))
                        salePrice =salePrice - discount
