Assignment 3
You are to use Linked Lists to do this programm. 
The "XYZ Widget Store" receives shipments of widgets at various costs. 
The store's policy is to charge a 30% markup,
and to sell widgets which were received earlier before widgets which v,'ere 
received later. This is called a First In First Out policy (FIFO). 

Write a program using linked lists that reads in 3 types of input data and does the following. 

    A sales record which contains an "S" in column 1 and a quantity which represents the number of 
    widgets sold. 
    
    A receipt record which contains an "R" in column 1 and a quantity and a price Which represents 
    the receipt of a quantity of widgets at the stated cost per widget. 
    
    A promotion card which contains a "P" in column 1 and a number such as 25 which would 
    represent a 25% discount to the next 2 buying customers (the next 2 sales cards) 

The program should... 

print a message after each receipt record is read in With the price Of the Widgets received.

print a message after each promotion card is read in with the amount of discount the next two 
customers will be receiving 
    
After a sales record is read in, print a message stating the number sold and the price of each 
widget and total price of the order. For example if 200 widgets were sold and there were 50 widgets at 
$1.00 and 100 at $2.00 and 50 at $3.00 print (recall the 30% markup and the FIFO policy) 

            200 Widgets sold 
            50 at 1.30each      Sales: $65.00 
            100 at 2.60 each    Sales: $260.00 
            50 at 3.90 each     sales. $195.00 
            Total sales: $520.00 

If there are insufficient number of widgets in stock to fill an order sell as many as are available and 
then print...

            "remainder of xxx Widgets not available 

Do not forget the promotional discount 
At the end of the data before exiting the Vogram print out under a separate heading the widgets 
still left in stock and their original purchase price.
